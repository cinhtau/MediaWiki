    <h3>Clan wars</h3>

    <p>In 1600, a war began between the Toyotomi and Tokugawa clans. Musashi apparently fought on the side of the
        Toyotomi's "Army of the West", as the Shinmen clan (to whom his family owed allegiance) had allied with them.
        Specifically, he participated in the attempt to take Fushimi castle by assault in July 1600, in the defense of
        the besieged Gifu Castle in August of the same year, and finally in the Battle of Sekigahara. Some doubt has
        been cast on this final battle, as the Hyoho senshi denki has Musashi saying he is "no lord's vassal" and
        refusing to fight with his father (in Lord Ukita's battalion) in the battle. Omitting the Battle of Sekigahara
        from the list of Musashi's battles would seem to contradict the The Book of Five Rings's statement that Musashi
        fought in six battles, however. Regardless, as the Toyotomi side lost, it has been suggested that Musashi fled
        as well and spent some time training on Mount Hiko.</p>
